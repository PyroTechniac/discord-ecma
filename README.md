# Discord-ECMA

Discord-ECMA is a ECMAScript framework for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org)

As this framework is written using esm modules, all files are required to be ECMAScript modules, and must be ran with the `--experimental-modules` flag in node

Being an ECMAScript module, this also means it is highly unstable in node, and may break randomly and unexpectedly
